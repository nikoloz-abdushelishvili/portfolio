# Projectile Motion Simulator

## Overview
This project is a **Projectile Motion Simulator** built using Python. It allows users to visualize and analyze the trajectory of objects launched at different angles and velocities, helping to understand the physics behind projectile motion.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to create a program that can:  
- Simulate the motion of a projectile in two dimensions  
- Allow users to input initial velocity, launch angle, and other parameters  
- Visualize the trajectory graphically  
- Calculate key metrics like maximum height, range, and flight time  

## How It Works
The simulator uses basic **kinematic equations** of motion under uniform gravity.  
The program calculates the position of the projectile at small time intervals and plots the trajectory using Python libraries.  
Users can change parameters like initial speed, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration to see how they affect motion.

## Software / Logic
- Takes user input for velocity, angle, and gravity  
- Computes horizontal and vertical positions over time  
- Uses Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib) to graph the trajectory  
- Displays key results: maximum height, range, and time of flight  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Matplotlib (for plotting graphs)  
- NumPy (for numerical calculations)  

## What I Learned
- Implementing physics equations in code  
- Visualizing mathematical models using Python  
- Using libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy  
- Translating real-world physics into interactive simulations  

## Future Improvements
- Add air resistance for more realistic simulation  
- Include multiple projectiles or scenarios  
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction
